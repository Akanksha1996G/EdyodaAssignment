Assignment 4 voting app
1)--> kubectl apply -f .
    this will create pods for all the .yaml files present in current directory. 
    
2)--> kubectl get svc
   And also for voting pod 31000 NodePort is assigned 
   And for result pod 31001 NodePort is assigned .
   
3) After accessing voting app with NodePort http://52.221.204.160:31000/ in browser we are able to vote.
   And accessing result pod  with NodePort http://52.221.204.160:31001/ in browser we are able to see result.
   
4) When tried deleting voting pod it created new voting pod instantly.
    -->kubectl delete pod vote-94849dc97-r6xbv

    after deleting worker it created new pod but app was not taking votes.
     -->kubectl delete pod worker-dd46d7584-48gcl   
     
     [root@ip-172-31-16-102 k8s-specifications]# kubectl get po
      NAME                      READY   STATUS            RESTARTS   AGE
      db-b54cd94f4-84z6b        2/2     Running           0          10m
      redis-868d64d78-bzq5r     2/2     Running           0          10m
      result-5d57b59f4b-szmj2   2/2     Running           0          10m
      vote-94849dc97-zf7tr      2/2     Running           0          2m17s
      worker-dd46d7584-48gcl    2/2     Terminating       0          10m
      worker-dd46d7584-zm47g    0/2     PodInitializing   0          6s

     
     
    and db pod same obeservation as after deleting it created new pods instantly.
    But deleting db pod old data of voting result is lost.
    -->kubectl delete pod db-b54cd94f4-84z6b
    
    [root@ip-172-31-16-102 k8s-specifications]# kubectl get po
    NAME                      READY   STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
    db-b54cd94f4-84z6b        2/2     Terminating   0          11m
    db-b54cd94f4-d2szs        1/2     Running       0          4s
    redis-868d64d78-bzq5r     2/2     Running       0          11m
    result-5d57b59f4b-szmj2   2/2     Running       0          11m
    vote-94849dc97-zf7tr      2/2     Running       0          2m48s
    worker-dd46d7584-zm47g    2/2     Running       0          37s

Assignment 1 Replica set
        In case of single copy of pod we should use daemonSet instead of RS, so that the pods can be garbage collected when we delete the daemonSet 
        and no new pod is created. If we want to have a single instance of pod on all nodes hen we go for daemonSet.
        
Assignment 3 Service
    1)--> sudo netstat -tulpn | grep LISTEN
        This will check the port status
    
    2)--> kubectl get svc
        If the port is already listening, then check the services whether it is on ClusterIP or NodePort.
        
    3)  --> kubectl apply -f replicaSet.yaml
        If it is ClusterIP, then we will change it to NodePort using 
        --> kubectl edit service #servicename
        
        Even after changing the type of Service if it is not working then we delete all the old pods and services and apply the replicaSet.yaml
        so that it will create the services again.
        
     4) After , we will try to run the application. If it fails to run again then the last option is to change the port in replicaSet.yaml
